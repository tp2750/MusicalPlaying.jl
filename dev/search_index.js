MIDI sets pitch 69 to A4 and 440 Hz. This can be modulated by a Tuning.\n    `loudness` is relative volume. A note of loudness 2 has twice the amplitued as one of loudness 1.\n    `duration` is the duration in beats. Typically a quater note has a duration of 1, and a half note a duration of 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
